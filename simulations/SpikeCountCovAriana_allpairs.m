% Compute spike count covariance matrix.
% s is a 2x(ns) matrix where ns is the number of spikes
% s(1,:) lists spike times
% and s(2,:) lists corresponding neuron indices
% Neuron indices are assumed to go from 1 to N
%
% Spikes are counts starting at time T1 and ending at 
% time T2.

% winsize is the window size over which spikes are counted,
% so winsize is assumed to be much smaller than T2-T1
%
% Covariances are only computed between neurons whose
% indices are listed in the vector Inds. If Inds is not
% passed in then all NxN covariances are computed.
